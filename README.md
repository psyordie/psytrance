# Drugs are bad

Not if digital!

# TODO

- score based on time and mouse movement
- remote controlling effects from other client VIA firebase - real party


Remote DJ:

- can add new levels (writes new CSS - woah crazy!)
- DJ sets song
- soundcloud api seek to; move playing song to sync with others

DJ is server; Clients compete to win; They need to move on to the beat! Hard to
implement, but would be totally awesome!
